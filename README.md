# CS-300 Data Structures, Algorithms, and Design

## Reflection

**Problem Solved:**  
In these projects, I focused on analyzing the runtime and memory usage of different data structures and implementing a program to sort and display courses in alphanumeric order. The goal was to practice selecting the right data structure for efficiency and clarity.

**Approach to the Problem:**  
I applied analysis of arrays, vectors, and linked lists to understand performance tradeoffs. For Project Two, I implemented sorting and output to demonstrate how algorithms and data structures combine to solve practical problems.

**Roadblocks and Solutions:**  
A challenge I faced was debugging sorting logic and handling file input. Careful step-by-step testing and validating smaller parts of the code helped me overcome these issues.

**Expanded Approach to Software Design:**  
This work taught me to think about efficiency and scalability early in the design process, not just correctness. I now consider data structure selection an essential part of design.

**Maintainable, Readable, Adaptable Code:**  
My work in this course improved my coding style by focusing on modular design, clear variable names, and comments. This will help me write programs that are easier to maintain, extend, and reuse in the future.
